Usage ðŸš€

This application serves an API route /api/random-character that returns a JSON object containing random character information.

On the frontend, the home page makes a request to the /api/random-character API route and displays the returned random character information.

The JSON object returned by the API looks like this:

json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "twitter": "@johndoe",
  "geohash": "u4pruydqqvj"
}
